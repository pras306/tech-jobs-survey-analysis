## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the Emerging Technology Skills and Trends. The main focus of the project is to determine the current and future trends in demand for skills related to programming languages, databases and other technologies. We also examine the demographics of technology professionals.

This project was implemented as a capstone project that I worked during IBM's course offered via Coursera.
